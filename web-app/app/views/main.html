	<h1>M-SPLearning introduction</h1>
	<p>The increasing presence of mobile devices in the society has motivated the use of these gadgets in several segments. This reality has contributed to the emergence of a new and innovative modality of learning â€“ the mobile learning, or simply, m-learning. In short, mobile learning is based on the use of a set of specific mobile applications, which possesses similar features and specific characteristics according to the learning goals. In a different but related perspective, the emerging reuse technique of Software Product Line (SPL) allows mass customization and systematic derivation of products, such as mobile learning applications. Motivated by this scenario, we have worked on the establishment of M-SPLearning, a SPL to the mobile learning applications domain. M-SPLearning has been developed throughout a proactive adoption model, according to the basics of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
