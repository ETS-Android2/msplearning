            <p class="lead">The popularity of mobile devices in all social classes has motivated the development of mobile learning (m-learning) applications. The existing applications, even having many benefits and facilities in relation to teaching and learning, still present problems and challenges, especially regarding the development, reuse and architectural standardization. Particularly, there is a growing adoption of the Software Product Line (SPL) concept, in view of research that investigates these gaps. This paradigm enables organizations to explore the similarities and variabilities of their products, increasing the reuse of artifacts and, consequently, reducing costs and development time. This work presents an SPL focused on the domain of m-learning applications, named M-SPLearning. The development of M-SPLearning has comprised since the initial study for an effective domain analysis until the implementation of the components previously analyzed. Such SPL had its products experimentally evaluated in the industrial scenario, providing evidences that its use can accelerate the time-to-market of m-learning applications, with a reduced number of faults.</p>
