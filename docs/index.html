            <p class="lead">Software Product Lines (SPL) aim at improving the product quality and time-to-market compared to single-system development. The central concept of such a reuse approach is variability, which provides diversity of software products in a specific domain. In a different perspective, the popularity of mobile devices has contributed to the increasing demand for mobile learning (m-learning) applications. However, despite the benefits provided to the teaching-learning process, m-learning still presents problems and challenges to its adoption. One of these problems is that the existing methods for developing software are still too generic and do not address specific aspects of m-learning applications. In addition, the SPL are still underexploited in the Brazilian software development industry. In this context, we discuss how systematic reuse can improve the development of solutions in the m-learning applications domain. For this, an SPL was developed aiming to explore the gaps identified in the Brazilian industry and academia, which we call M-SPLearning. We experimentally evaluated such SPL in the industry, providing preliminary evidence that well-defined variabilities can speed up time-to-market of m-learning products, with a reduced number of faults.</p>
