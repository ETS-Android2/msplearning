            <p class="lead"><b>Abstract:</b> Software Product Lines (SPL) aim at improving the product quality and time-to-market of the development methodology of singular software. The central concept of such a reuse approach is variability, which provides diversity of software products in a specific domain. In a different perspective, the popularity of mobile devices has contributed to the increasing demand for mobile learning (m-learning) applications. However, despite the benefits provided in the context of teaching and learning, m-learning still presents problems and challenges in its adoption. One of these problems is that the existing methods for developing software are very generic and do not address specific aspects of mobile learning applications. In this paper we discuss how variability can improve the development of m-learning applications by adopting a concise variability management approach. An SPL for m-learning applications has been developed and experimentally evaluated in industry, providing preliminary evidence that well-defined variabilities can speed up time-to-market of m-learning products, with a reduced number of faults.</p>
